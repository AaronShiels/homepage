            <p>Hi, I'm Aaron ðŸ‘‹</p>
            <br />
            <p>
              I am currently working as a software architect at <strong>Match Group</strong>'s Evergreen and Emerging division. Under the "Evergreen" banner, I
              work on maintaining and growing the backend platforms of a portfolio of well known dating brands, including <strong>Plenty of Fish</strong>,{" "}
              <strong>Match.com</strong>, and <strong>OkCupid</strong>. Under the "Emerging" banner, I work on new and experimental products and business
              avenues for the group.
            </p>
            <br />
            In my role as architect, I am responsible for building and executing on a technical vision for the platforms I work on. Some of my achievements
            while in this role include:
            <ul>
              <li>
                The delivery of and migration to a <strong>mature, distributed dating platform</strong> to replace the aging legacy systems.
              </li>
              <li>
                Guidance and evangilism of the (then) new guiding patterns and principles for the future platform, <strong>microservice architecture</strong>,{" "}
                <strong>event-driven architecture</strong>, and <strong>CQRS</strong> to name a few.
              </li>
              <li>
                Evaluation and successful adoption of modern hosting solutions, including <strong>Kubernetes</strong> and <strong>cloud services</strong>.
              </li>
              <li>
                Design and delivery of a flexible <strong>API gateway solution</strong> in order to present the disparate components of the platform as a
                single, homogeneous API.
              </li>
              <li>
                Evaluation, adoption, and evangilism of a <strong>true continuous integration/continuous delivery</strong> pipeline, with a strong emphasis of{" "}
                test-driven development power by Docker Compose.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </div>
        </div>
      </section>
    </main>
